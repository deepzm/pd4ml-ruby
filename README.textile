h3. Usage

Using PDF::PD4ML is trivial. The example below illustrates a simple
use with an output file:

  require "pd4ml"
  pdf = PDF::PD4ML.new
  pdf.add_content "&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;"
  pdf.pdf_password = "quentin"
  pdf.save_to('output.pdf')

In the example above, it's not necessary to call the <tt>generate</tt>
method since it will be automatically invoked by <tt>save_to</tt>.

You can also configure the program path for PD4ML if it differs in
your system.

  PDF::PD4ML.jar_path = "#{Rails.root}/extras/pd4ml/pd4ml.jar"
  PDF::PD4ML.java_path = "/usr/bin/java"
  PDF::PD4ML.font_path = "#{Rails.root}/extras/fonts"
