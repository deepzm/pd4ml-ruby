h2. Usage

Using PDF::PD4ML is trivial. The example below illustrates a simple
use which generates a PDF file and show it inline to the browser:

  
  html_content = <<-HTML
    <code><h1>Whoops!</h1></code>
    <code><p>Look at the stuff I am not doing!</p></code>
  HTML
  
  pdf = PDF::PD4ML.new(
    :bookmark_elements          => 'HEADINGS',
    :allow_annotate             => true, 
    :allow_copy                 => false, 
    :allow_modify               => false, 
    :allow_print                => true
  )
  
  pdf << html_content
  
  pdf.user_password = "quentin"
  
  send_data(pdf.generate,  
    :type         => "application/pdf",
    :filename     => "hello.pdf",
    :disposition  => "attachment"
  )

If you want to save the file to a folder on the server itself, say the code
was running in a batch job, you simply use the <tt>save_to</tt> method instead
of the <tt>generate</tt> method.

  pdf.save_to "#{Rails.root}/public/pdfs/hello.pdf"
    
You can set the individual options also, instead of passing them as a hash to the new
method:

  pdf.set_option :allow_print, true
  pdf.set_option :html_width, 650

The default options are as follows:

  @@default_options = {
    :html_width         => 800,
    :page_dimension     => 'A4',
    :page_orientation   => 'PORTRAIT',
    :inset_unit         => 'mm',
    :inset_left         => 20,
    :inset_top          => 10,
    :inset_right        => 10,
    :inset_bottom       => 10,
    :bookmark_elements  => 'HEADINGS',
    :allow_annotate     => true, 
    :allow_copy         => true, 
    :allow_modify       => true, 
    :allow_print        => true,
    :debug              => false
  }

For the detailed explanation, refer to the "PD4ML documentation":http://pd4ml.com/support.htm

You can customize the paths for the various external dependencies. You will need
the java runtime, PD4ML library and fonts, if you are using an custom TTF fonts.  

  PDF::PD4ML.jar_path = "#{Rails.root}/extras/pd4ml/pd4ml.jar"
  PDF::PD4ML.java_path = "/usr/bin/java"
  PDF::PD4ML.font_path = "#{Rails.root}/extras/fonts"
